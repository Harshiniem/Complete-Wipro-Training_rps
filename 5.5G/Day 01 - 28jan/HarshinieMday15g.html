    <div class="section-card ran-card">
        <div class="card-content">
            <h2>2. Radio Access Network (RAN) Companies</h2>
            <p><strong>What is RAN?</strong> The RAN is the "bridge" between your device and the core network. It consists of the cell towers, antennas, and base stations you see in the physical world. It manages the radio spectrum to ensure your phone can send and receive data without interference.</p>
            
            <div class="sub-heading">Components of RAN:</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>RU (Radio Unit):</strong> The physical antenna that transmits/receives signals.</li>
                <li><strong>DU (Distributed Unit):</strong> Handles the real-time processing of the data.</li>
                <li><strong>CU (Centralized Unit):</strong> Manages non-real-time tasks and coordinates multiple DUs.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="sub-heading">Major Players & Origins:</div>

            <h2>3. Core Network (The Central Nervous System)</h2>
            <p><strong>What is 5G Core?</strong> If RAN is the "arms" reaching out to users, the Core is the "brain." It is a cloud-native framework that handles subscriber data, authentication, security, and switching. 5G Core (5GC) allows for <strong>Network Slicing</strong> (creating mini-networks for specific uses like emergency services or gaming).</p>
            
            <div class="sub-heading">Core Functions:</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AMF (Access and Mobility Management):</strong> Tracks where you are so calls find you.</li>

    <!-- FINAL SUMMARY -->
    <div class="summary-box">
        <h2>Summary of the Ecosystem</h2>
        <p>The telecommunications world is a vertical stack. It starts with the <strong>Chipset</strong> (the internal engine), connects through the <strong>RAN</strong> (the physical towers), is managed by the <strong>Core Network</strong> (the central software), and finally reaches the <strong>Device</strong> (your phone). Every step requires precise coordination between these multi-billion dollar companies to ensure that when you tap "Search," the world's information appears in milliseconds.</p>
